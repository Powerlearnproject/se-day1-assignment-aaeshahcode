-1960s: Software Crisis & Structured Programming:
The "software crisis" highlighted the need for a more structured approach to software development, leading to the introduction of structured programming techniques-

-1990s: Agile & Web Development:
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged, emphasizing iterative development and collaboration, while the rise of the internet led to the development of web applications and web engineering. 

Hardware Milestones
-The introduction of microprocessors in the 1970s revolutionized personal computing, making computers more accessible and leading to a surge in software development. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement - Gathering and documenting user needs and requirements.
Design- Creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - Writing the code and building the software according to the design specification
Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements.
Deployment - Releasing the software to users and customers
Maintainance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancement to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential software development approach with distinct phases while the Agile model is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation. Agile prioritizes customer involvement and flexibility for change, while Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages. 
waterfall methodology 
- Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
- changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Examples of projects where the waterfall model would be appropriate are:
Constructing a bridge: The project follows a similar step by step approach, it begins with the design and ends with the final construction.
Developing a new mobile application with a fixed feature set: If the requirements are well-defined and there are few changes expected during the project lifecycle then the waterfall model can be used.


agile methodology 
- Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Examples of projects where the waterfall model would be appropriate are:
Relaunching a website: Agile allows for flexibility in incorporating new features and addressing user feedback as the website is being developed and released.
Developing a new e-commerce platform: Agile allows for flexibility in integrating new features and addressing user feedback as the platform is being developed and released. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer 
- developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer
- collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
- confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager
 - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
Importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Keeping Up with Technology: The software development landscape is constantly changing, with new programming languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies emerging regularly. 
Solution/Strategies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests 
This Verifies individual components or modules of the software to ensure they function correctly in isolation.  Unit tests are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. 
Importance
It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Early defect detection, reduces the cost of fixing bugs later. 

Integration tests
Checks the interaction between different modules or components to ensure they work together seamlessly. 
Importance
Identifies integration issues.
Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

System Testing:
Tests the complete, integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. 
Importance
Validates the overall functionality, identifies system-level defects. 
It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security 

Acceptance Testing:
Evaluates the software against user requirements and business needs to ensure it meets their expectations and is ready for release. 
They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
Importance
Provides user validation, ensures the software meets real-world needs.
