Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering priciples, methods and tools, to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Software Engineering is crucial because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspect of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare. Software engineering is crucial in driving innovation, shaping technology, ensuring security, and enabling collaboration.
It's importance include:
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine


-1960s: Software Crisis & Structured Programming:
The "software crisis" highlighted the need for a more structured approach to software development, leading to the introduction of structured programming techniques-

-1990s: Agile & Web Development:
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged, emphasizing iterative development and collaboration, while the rise of the internet led to the development of web applications and web engineering. 

Hardware Milestones
-The introduction of microprocessors in the 1970s revolutionized personal computing, making computers more accessible and leading to a surge in software development. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement - Gathering and documenting user needs and requirements.
Design


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
